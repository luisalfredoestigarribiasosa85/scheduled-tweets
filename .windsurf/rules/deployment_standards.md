description: Provides guidelines for deploying a Rails application, ensuring that environment configurations, asset precompilation via the asset pipeline, and CI/CD integrations are set up properly without relying on Capistrano.

      Deployment configurations should:
      1. Separate environment-specific settings clearly.
      2. Precompile assets using the Rails asset pipeline (e.g., via `rake assets:precompile`).
      3. Integrate with CI/CD pipelines (like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.) to automate tests and deployment.
      4. Use environment variables to manage sensitive data.
      5. Include clear documentation for deployment procedures.

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad example: Hardcoding environment settings and missing asset precompilation steps.
      # config/deploy/production.rb
      ENV['RAILS_ENV'] = "production"
      # Missing asset precompilation and CI/CD integration details.
    output: "Avoid hardcoding configurations; leverage environment variables and include steps for asset precompilation and CI/CD integration."
  - input: |
      # Good example: Deployment configuration snippet for CI/CD integration.
      # config/deploy/production.rb
      Rails.application.configure do
        config.cache_classes = true
        config.eager_load = true
        # Other production settings...
      end
      # CI/CD pipeline should include:
      #   - Setting ENV variables securely
      #   - Running `rake assets:precompile` before deployment
    output: "Deployment configuration clearly separates production settings and outlines CI/CD requirements without relying on Capistrano."
