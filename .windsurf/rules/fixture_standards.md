# Fixture Standards and Best Practices

<rule>
name: fixture_standards
description: >
  This rule ensures that all test fixtures are stored exclusively within the
  test/fixtures folder and strictly match the current database schema. Fixtures 
  must be maintained according to changes reflected in the db/schema.rb file, with
  particular attention to column names and types. All tests must rely on these 
  fixtures to guarantee data consistency and reproducibility across test environments.
  
filters:
  - type: path
    pattern: "^test/fixtures(/.*)?\\.(yml|yaml)$"
  - type: content

actions:
  - type: error
    message: |
      Fixture files must be located under the 'test/fixtures' directory only and
      must exactly match the current database schema. Common errors include:
      - Using column names that don't exist in the schema
      - Missing required columns (null: false)
      - Incorrect data types for columns

      # Fixture Best Practices
      
      1. **Directory Structure and Naming**:
         - Store all fixtures in `test/fixtures/` directory
         - Name fixture files to EXACTLY match the corresponding database table name in schema.rb
         - For tables with prefixes (e.g., `safety_report_*`), include the FULL prefix in the file name
         - Use nested folders ONLY when the model itself has a namespaced structure
         - Always verify fixture names match table names with `grep -r "create_table" db/schema.rb`
      
      2. **Schema Synchronization**:
         - After each schema change (`db/schema.rb`), update affected fixtures immediately
         - Include ALL required attributes (those with `null: false` in schema)
         - Set appropriate data for foreign key relationships
         - Match data types in fixtures to those in schema (strings, integers, booleans, etc.)
         - Use ERB for dynamic values: `<%= Time.current.iso8601 %>`
         - IMPORTANT: Verify all column names exist in schema before using them
      
      3. **Schema Validation Steps**:
         - Before adding a column to a fixture:
           1. Check schema.rb: `grep -A 20 "create_table \\"table_name\\"" db/schema.rb`
           2. Verify the column exists and note its type
           3. Ensure the value matches the column type
         - After schema migrations:
           1. Run `bin/rails db:schema:load RAILS_ENV=test`
           2. Run `bin/rails test:prepare` to verify fixtures
           3. Fix any fixture load errors before proceeding
      
      4. **Common Fixture Errors and Solutions**:
         ```ruby
         # Error: table "X" has no column named "Y"
         # Solution: Check schema.rb for actual column names
         
         # Error: Validation failed: X can't be blank
         # Solution: Add missing required field to fixture
         
         # Error: wrong type for column "X"
         # Solution: Match schema.rb data type
         ```
      
      5. **Polymorphic Associations**:
         - For polymorphic relationships, use the proper class name format in `*_type` fields
         - Ensure `*_type` and `*_id` fields correctly pair together
         - Example for polymorphic witness association:
           ```yaml
           # safety_report_witnesses.yml
           witness_one:
             witnessable_type: "SafetyReportAutoIncident"
             witnessable_id: 1
             name: "John Doe"
           ```
      
      6. **Organization and References**:
         - Use meaningful names for fixture records (e.g., `admin_user` not `one`)
         - Group related fixtures together with comments
         - Use explicit IDs to ensure stable associations between related fixtures
         - Reference associations directly by ID or with ActiveRecord helpers:
           ```yaml
           # Using explicit IDs
           post_comment:
             post_id: 1
             author_id: 2
             
           # Using ActiveRecord helpers
           post_comment:
             post_id: <%= ActiveRecord::FixtureSet.identify(:featured_post) %>
             author_id: <%= ActiveRecord::FixtureSet.identify(:admin_user) %>
           ```
      
      7. **Data Type Consistency**:
         - Strings: Use quotes for clarity `"Example string"`
         - Booleans: Use true/false (not strings)
         - Integers: Use unquoted numbers
         - Null values: Use null or ~ (not empty strings)
         - Enums: Use the string/symbol representation, not the integer value
         - Dates/Times: Use ISO format or ERB helpers
      
      8. **Fixture Validation Process**:
         - Periodically validate fixtures against schema with these steps:
           1. Check table existence: `grep -r "create_table" db/schema.rb`
           2. Verify fixture matches table: Compare file name with table name
           3. Validate required fields: Check all `null: false` fields are present
           4. Test fixture loading: `bin/rails test:prepare` should run without errors
         - Run a smoke test loading fixtures: `bin/rails runner 'puts ModelName.first.inspect'`
         - When tests fail with fixture errors:
           1. Check the exact error message (e.g., missing column)
           2. Verify schema.rb for the correct structure
           3. Update fixtures to match current schema
           4. Run tests again to verify fix
      
      9. **Usage in Tests**:
         - Reference fixtures using the `fixtures :users, :posts` syntax
         - Access fixture data via `users(:admin)` or `posts(:published)`
         - Avoid creating test data outside of fixtures where possible
         - Use transactional fixtures to maintain test isolation

      Fixture files must exactly match the current database schema structure.
      Always verify column names and types in schema.rb before creating or updating fixtures.
