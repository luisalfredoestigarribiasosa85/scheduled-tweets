      Library files should:
      1. Be organized into appropriate subdirectories.
      2. Include clear documentation and inline comments.
      3. Follow Ruby naming conventions and modular structure.
      4. Avoid duplicating functionality already provided by Rails or gems.
      5. Be tested to ensure reliability.
