      When writing a Cursor rule:

      1. Required Frontmatter Structure:
         ```markdown
          ---
          description: Clear, concise purpose of the rule
          globs: 
            - "pattern/to/match/**/*.rb"    # Primary file pattern
            - "other/pattern/**/*.erb"      # Additional patterns if needed
          ---

      2. Required Sections (in order):
         ```markdown
         # Title in Title Case

         <rule>
         name: rule_name_in_snake_case
         description: Detailed description of rule's purpose and scope

         filters:
           - type: file_extension|file_name|path|content|event
             pattern: "regex_pattern"
             # Add comments explaining complex patterns

               Clear guidance with:
               
               1. Context or Purpose
               2. Code Examples
               3. Best Practices
               4. Common Pitfalls
               5. Related Documentation

         examples:
           - input: |
               # Bad example
               example_of_bad_code
               
               # Good example
               example_of_good_code
             output: "Explanation of why the good example is preferred"

         metadata:
           priority: high|medium|low
           version: 1.0
           related_rules:
             - other_relevant_rule
           responsibility: "What this rule enforces"
         </rule>
         ```

      3. Code Block Standards:
         - Use proper language identifiers
         - Include file paths for file-specific examples
         - Use descriptive comments
         - Show both good and bad examples
         - Include expected output

      4. Message Formatting:
         - Use numbered lists for steps
         - Use bullet points for related items
         - Include code examples in backticks
         - Use proper markdown formatting
         - Keep line length under 80 characters

      5. Metadata Requirements:
         - priority: Importance level
         - version: Rule version number
         - related_rules: Other relevant rules
         - responsibility: Rule's specific focus
         - standard_patterns: Common patterns to reference

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad - Missing sections

      ---
      <rule>
      name: incomplete_rule
