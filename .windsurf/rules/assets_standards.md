    # Applies to all assets in the app/assets and vendor/assets directories

    message: |
      Asset files should:
      1. Be organized into clear subdirectories (javascripts, stylesheets, images).
      2. Follow Rails naming conventions and file structure.
      3. Use StimulusJS/Hotwire/Turbo for JavaScript interactions without relying on Webpacker.
      4. Contain comments and documentation where necessary.
      5. Strictly avoid inline JavaScript within view templates.

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad example: Assets are unorganized and contain inline scripts
      <script>
        // Inline JavaScript in the view
      </script>
    output: "Assets should reside in the proper directories and avoid inline scripts."
  - input: |
      # Good example: Properly organized asset with StimulusJS integration
      // File: app/assets/javascripts/controllers/user_controller.js
      import { Controller } from "stimulus";

      export default class extends Controller {
        connect() {
          console.log('User controller connected');
        }
      }
    output: "Asset is organized in the asset pipeline and uses StimulusJS appropriately."
