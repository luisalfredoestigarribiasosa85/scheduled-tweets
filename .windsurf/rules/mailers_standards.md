      Mailers should:
      1. Inherit from ApplicationMailer.
      2. Use descriptive names that reflect the purpose of the email.
      3. Include proper layout usage and localization where needed.
      4. Handle errors gracefully, especially when sending emails.
      5. Keep email templates simple and maintainable.

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad example: Mailer not inheriting from ApplicationMailer and missing error handling.
      class NotificationMailer
        def welcome_email(user)
          # code to send email
        end
      end
    output: "Mailers should inherit from ApplicationMailer and handle errors appropriately."
  - input: |
      # Good example
      class NotificationMailer < ApplicationMailer
        def welcome_email(user)
          @user = user
          mail(to: @user.email, subject: 'Welcome!')
        end
      end
    output: "Mailer follows Rails conventions with proper inheritance, naming, and usage."
